# Automobile-Price-Predicton
In this project I have done EDA on a given dataset to predict the price of the Automobile using Machine Learning.
# About the Dataset
- This data comprises of 205 rows and 25 columns.
- There are 25 columns containing different features for the help in predicting the price of the car, which are both categorical and numerical data.
- There are few categorical feature like brand name,fuel type,body-style,engine, etc. Also there are numerical features to support the prediction better like mileage,height,number of cylinders etc.
# Process and Conclusions
- Firstly, it was needed to seperate the numerical and categorical columns.
- Then performing EDA on the data to get the best features which is helping to complete the Prediction of the price.
- With the help of different graphs we'll make get both categorical and numerical features which drives our prediction analysis further.
- Also, conclusion we'll make by usig the heatmap is that Price of the car and Engine Size is 87% correlated.
- Now, in the end we'll perform Simple Regression Model and Multiple Linear Regression and comes to the conclusion that Multiple Regression gives more accuracy it has high R-Squared Value.
